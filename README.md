This project aims to categorize the chest images from an X-ray image dataset using PyTorch in three different classes; Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19. 

The purpose of conducting this project is to learn the implementation of convolutional neural networks in PyTorch. This program shall not be used for diagnosis purposes. The primary source of this project is Amit Yadav's guided project on Coursera called [Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X Ray using PyTorch](https://www.coursera.org/projects/covid-19-detection-x-ray). In addition, the program has been modified by Romina Bahrami for self-studying purposes. 

The dataset is retrieved from  [COVID-19 Radiography Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) on Kaggle.
